# Project-Snowboard Requirements:

### Vision:
Our vision for this product is for a user to be able to learn about snowboarding, the importance of the different type of gear and to be able to take a test that will provide gear recommendations. The results of the gear recommendations will then suggest specific gear that a user could then purchase. 

This product solves the pain point of figuring out what kind of gear a first time snowboarder would need, or someone who is looking to upgrade their gear. 

Our product is an comprehensive guide about snowboarding and provides all the information about beginning the snowsport as well as being able to recommend the ideal gear needed.

The quiz will then return an output of personalized snowgear derived from the user's answers.
