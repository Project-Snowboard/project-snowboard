                <p>The bindings are what interfaces you with your board. Just like boots, choosing a proper flex for your riding style and ability will be imperative for all day comfort. When looking around for bindings, you’ll notice most are rated on a flex scale of 1-10 (1 being the softest, 10 being the stiffest). <br><br>

                Softer bindings are ideal for park riding (soft or mid-soft). You’ll want more flexibility for over rotations and jibbing (if you’re not familiar with this term yet; it is the action of jumping, sliding, or riding on objects). <br><br>
                    
                Medium flex bindings are an ideal match for all mountain boards. A medium flexibility gives your enough support for more contentious terrain, but is still pliable enough for park terrain. <br><br>
                    
                You’ll want stiffer bindings for powder riding, less flexibility allows for quicker responsiveness and the post power transference.
