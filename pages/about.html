        <p> Software developer first, outdoor connoisseur second. Growing up in the beautiful state of Washington, I have always had access to its dynamic landscape. <br>
            At an early age, I began to take advantage of the vast hiking trails and mountains that were nearby. In my spare time, I like to design and create clothing projects. <br>
            The snowboarding culture has its own robust variation of clothing, so my current project involves creating a set of snowboarding gear.</p>
