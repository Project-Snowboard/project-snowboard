                <p style="text-indent: 30px">You’ll want to put the same consideration into choosing pants as you would for choosing a jacket; what is the temperature of the environment like? One thing to consider is the level of waterproofing. You’ll notice ratings typically between 5,000-20,000mm, the higher the number the higher the waterproof ratings. For climates that are warmer and more humid you’ll want a higher waterproof rating, while climates that are drier and cooler, you can use a lower waterproof rating. A few other features to consider are gaiters, vents, and if the pants have the ability to connect to your jacket. Gaiters create a seal to keep snow out of your boots, and pants. Vents allow you to release heat when things start to heat up, and connecting your pants to your jacket will help create a snow proof barrier. Hardshell pants can come insulated or uninsulated, for people who run warmer, uninsulated pants allow breathability and if you do get cold underlayers can be added. If you are someone who is always cold, insulated pants will probably be a better choice.
