                <p>The biggest factor to consider when figuring out which boots are right for you is the flex. The stiffness of the boot will determine how responsive they are to your technique and riding style. <br><br>

                More flexible boots are ideal for beginners because they are more forgiving to poor technique, and therefore you are less likely to wipe out or get injured. These boots may also be a good preference for park riding because more flexibility makes it easier to shift your weight. <br><br>
                    
                Stiffer boots are more ideal for advanced riders because they tend to be more aggressive and have harder landings. Stiffer boots are more responsive to fast and aggressive movements.
