            <h2>
                <p> helmets are cool. get one.</p>
                <p style="text-indent: 30px"> seriously though, these things will save your life over and over agin.
                    When you biff it and become a glorious lifesize human ragdoll cartwheeling down the side of a
                    mountain, you'll be glad you decided to purchase a helmet. The false sense of invulnerability you
                    get from dawning a brain bucket makes your fear of slamming into hard ojects a thing of the past,
                    and in turn makes snowboarding more fun!

                <p style="text-indent: 30px"> There is not a lot to helmets, other than style choice, but there a few
                    things to consider. Find one that fits your head, to start. It shouldn't choke you, and it shouldn't
                    wiggle around on your head. Remember, you'll be wearing this thing a lot. Lighter helmets are better
                    because a heavy helmet will start to weigh down your neck at the end of the day. Try to find a
                    helmet that fits your goggles so there is no gap between the helmet and the goggles. You'll
                    occasionally hear other boarders mention "gappers". Don't be one... but mostly, a forehead can get
                    oddly uncomfortable while parting 30-50MPH below freezing wind. Last tip, get a helmet with a bill.
                    The bill keeps snow from falling on to the top of your goggles and melting into them. If the water
                    drips down in there you'll be fighting fog for the rest of the day. </p>
