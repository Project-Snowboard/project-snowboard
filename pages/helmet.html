                <p style="text-indent: 30px">Probably the most important tool you’ll need! Wiping out occasionally is unavoidable (especially if you’re new) and just like any activity that has the potential for your head to impact a hard surface, proper protection is recommended. You won’t need a helmet specific to your riding preference or ability but you do have options.</p>

                <p style="text-indent: 30px">An in-mold helmet will be lighter and sleeker, while an injection-mold helmet will offer a greater amount of shock absorption and durability. We also recommend getting your helmet sized to fit your head. Your helmet should fit snugly (but not too tight).</p>  
                    
                <p style="text-indent: 30px">There are other cool features you can explore like camera mounts and built in audio.
