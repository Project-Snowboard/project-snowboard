            <h2>
                <p style="text-indent: 30px"> You may be tempted to buy a $30 pair of goggles your first go around, but
                    don't do it! This is the one part of your gear that you need to go high end on. It doesn't matter
                    how good the rest of your gear is, if you can't see where you're going, you will have a bad time.
                    The cheaper googles will keep the snow out of your eyes, but where they fail is with thier anti fog.
                    They don't have any! If your googles fog up in the middle of your dream line you'll miss out on
                    those freshies. Higher end goggles tend to have a good anti fog coating on them. It's very important
                    not to touch the inside of the goggles. If you get snow in them just tap them out, do not wipe them
                    or you will damage the anti fog coating on the lens. As far as the tint goes, dark lenses look cool,
                    but in overcast or flat lighting they will take the depth out of the snow and leave you with super fun 
                    suprise drops and jumps. Save the dark lenses for bright sunny days, and find light pink or yellow
                    lenses for cloudy or foggy days.</p>
